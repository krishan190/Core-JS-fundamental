<!-- ⚡ Interview-Safe Explanation

👉 “Mixins are like reusable functions in CSS preprocessors (Sass/LESS). They let us define a block of styles once and
include it wherever needed. They support parameters too, making them flexible. The principle is the DRY rule — avoid
repetition, improve maintainability, and encapsulate reusable design patterns like flex layouts, border-radius, or
shadows.” -->

<!-- "If I want to write CSS directly inside HTML, I cannot use mixins because they are a preprocessor feature. Instead, I’d create reusable utility classes to mimic mixin behavior." -->
