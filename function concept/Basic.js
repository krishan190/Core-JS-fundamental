// function in javascript

// 1=> What is function declaration?
// 2=> What is function Expression?

const square1 = function (num) {
    return num * num;
}

console.log(square1(5));

// 3=> What are the First class function?

// where a function are treated like a variable there function calls a first class function in this cases we pass function in
// another function as a argument and can be used and manipulated and return from those function.

// means that everything that varible do function can also do

function square(num) {
    return num * num;
}


function displaySquare(fn) {
    console.log("square is " + fn(5));

}

displaySquare(square);


// 4=> What is IIFE - O/P based question

(function (x) {
    return (function (y) {
        console.log(x);//1
    })(2);
})(1);

// x is search inside the inner scope of y function if its not find then it would be go to the parent scope
// it happens because of closure

// the ability of a function to access a variables and functions that are lexically out of its scope are called closure.
// closures are created whenever functions are created because of that function has referece to its outer scope

// 5=> Function scope

for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
}

// Reason==>(In case of var) here concept is applicable that scope with var and js execution flow

// The loop finishes, and i becomes 5. Since var has a function scope (or global scope in this case), 
// there is only one variable i that is shared across all iterations. The loop completes its execution 
// very quickly, and by the time it's done, the value of i has been incremented to its final value of 5.
