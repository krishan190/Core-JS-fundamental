// 🚀 Rest Parameter vs Spread Operator in JavaScript – Explained Simply

// If you’re learning JS, these two lines of syntax can save you hours of code and a lot of bugs.
// JavaScript gives us two powerful features that look the same (...) but behave very differently:

// ✨ Rest Parameter
// 👉 Collects multiple arguments into a single array.
// Here, ...numbers bundles all arguments into an array → [1,2,3,4].

// ✨ Spread Operator
// 👉 Expands an array/object into individual elements.
// Here, ... unpacks values of arrays/objects.

// 🤔 When to Use Which?
// 🔸Rest: Inside a function definition (function myFunction(...args)) to collect arguments.
// 🔸Rest → gathers things into an array (many → one).
// 🔸Spread: Anywhere you want to expand elements of an array or object ([...myArray], {...myObject}).
// 🔸Spread → spreads elements out (one → many).

// 🌟 As a beginner, just remember:
// 🔸Rest is like a vacuum cleaner 🌀 → collects things.
// 🔸Spread is like a hand fan 🌬️ → spreads them out.
